## Executive Summary

CVE-2026-1522 is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Open5GS up to version 2.7.6, affecting the SGW‑C (Serving Gateway Control) component via the `sgwc_s5c_handle_modify_bearer_response` handler. A crafted control-plane message on the S5‑C interface can trigger improper buffer handling, leading to process termination and service disruption. The exploit has been publicly disclosed, and the issue is fixed by commit `b19cf6a`.

Although Open5GS models 4G/5G core network elements that are highly relevant to telecom infrastructure, this specific vulnerability only allows for **service disruption** on an internal control-plane interface and does not facilitate code execution or data exfiltration. Attackers must already be in a position to send S5‑C control-plane traffic (i.e. inside or adjacent to the operator/core network), and deliberate DoS against internal core components is generally counterproductive for stealthy attackers. Under the Work-Averse Attacker model, this is therefore classified as Tier 4: low kill chain utility and primarily of theoretical or niche sabotage interest.

Assessment Tier: TIER 4 (Scheduled – Internal Core Network DoS)
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/dpi/T4/TIER_4_26-02-04_CVE-2026-1522.md
Rationale:
- Affects SGW‑C control-plane logic in Open5GS; exploit causes denial of service, not code execution
- Exploitation requires access to internal S5‑C control-plane interfaces, not normally exposed to the public internet
- Once inside a telecom core environment, silent persistence and data access are generally more valuable than overt service disruption
- Aligns with Kill Chain Economics guidance that internal/local DoS on non-network-reachable software is Tier 4
Attractiveness Score: LOW
DPI Relevance: Telecom Core Infrastructure (Open5GS)

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Software and Deployment Context

- **Software:** Open5GS ≤ 2.7.6
- **Component:** SGWC (Serving Gateway Control), specifically `sgwc_s5c_handle_modify_bearer_response` in `src/sgwc/s5c-handler.c`
- **Role:** Implements parts of the EPC/EPC‑like core, handling S5‑C control-plane signalling between SGW‑C and PGW‑C
- **Deployment:**
  - Used in testbeds, R&D environments, and some smaller or lab-grade deployments for LTE/5G core experimentation and limited production.
  - Typically deployed on internal networks, with S5‑C traffic restricted to trusted core components.

The vulnerable interface is part of the mobile core control plane, not an internet-facing user plane or management UI.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics

- **Root cause:** A weakness in how SGW‑C processes Modify Bearer Response messages on the S5‑C interface, leading to memory mismanagement and process failure when presented with crafted input.
- **Exploit path:**
  1. An attacker capable of sending S5‑C messages constructs a malformed Modify Bearer Response.
  2. When the SGW‑C processes this message via `sgwc_s5c_handle_modify_bearer_response`, the logic hits the vulnerable path.
  3. This can trigger memory corruption or an assertion failure leading to SGW‑C process termination.
- **Impact:**
  - Loss or degradation of SGW‑C service, potentially disrupting bearer modification operations and impacting user-plane traffic until recovery.

There is no indication of controlled code execution; the effect is availability-only.

### 3. Kill Chain Utility Assessment

**Prerequisites and exposure**

- To exploit CVE-2026-1522, an attacker must:
  - Have the ability to inject traffic onto the S5‑C control-plane network segment, or
  - Control another compromised core network element with access to this interface.
- These conditions imply **significant prior compromise** or privileged positioning within a telecom core or testbed environment.

**Attacker gain**

- The only direct gain is denial of service:
  - Temporary outage or instability of SGW‑C functions
  - Possible service degradation for subscribers whose bearers traverse the affected gateway
- For most rational attackers seeking persistence, data access, or covert control, such disruption:
  - Draws attention
  - Risks rapid detection and response
  - Does not materially improve their long-term position.

**Kill chain utility**

- Viewing this through Kill Chain Economics:
  - High prerequisite cost (core network access)
  - Low or negative long-term gain (DoS that invites investigation)
  - Therefore, poor return on effort for typical adversaries

This supports a Tier 4 classification: important to patch for reliability and resilience, but not a priority from an adversarial economics standpoint.

### 4. Organisational and DPI Context

- **Telecom operators and labs:** Open5GS is often used in labs, innovation platforms, and small-scale deployments rather than large national cores, but the pattern is representative of core control-plane DoS issues.
- **DPI relevance:** Telecom core networks are critical DPI, but this particular vulnerability:
  - Only impacts availability
  - Requires an attacker already inside or adjacent to tightly controlled control-plane environments
- For defenders, it is primarily a **resilience and robustness** issue, not a leading edge of external attack.

### 5. Recommended Mitigations

- **Patching:**
  - Upgrade Open5GS to a version including commit `b19cf6a` or later, which corrects the vulnerable handler.
  - Ensure all SGW‑C instances in lab or production are rebuilt or redeployed with the fix.
- **Network and architecture controls:**
  - Maintain strict segmentation of S5‑C and other control-plane interfaces.
  - Limit access to these segments to authenticated and authorised core components only.
  - Enforce mutual authentication and integrity protection on control-plane signalling where feasible.
- **Monitoring and resilience:**
  - Monitor SGW‑C processes for unexpected restarts or crashes.
  - Implement redundancy and failover for SGW‑C to minimise service impact in the event of crashes.

These measures address the reliability concern while recognising that, for most rational attackers, CVE-2026-1522 is not an economically attractive exploitation target.
