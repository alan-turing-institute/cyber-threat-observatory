## Vulnerability Details

### Technical Description

The vulnerability exists in Kanboard versions 1.2.48 and below when the `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH` feature is enabled. The application blindly trusts HTTP headers (such as `X-Forwarded-User`, `Remote-User`, or similar reverse proxy authentication headers) for user authentication without verifying that the request originated from a trusted reverse proxy.

**Root Cause:** Improper validation of reverse proxy authentication headers. The application accepts user identity from HTTP headers without verifying the request source, allowing attackers to spoof headers and impersonate any user.

**Vulnerable Configuration:** Requires `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH` to be enabled in Kanboard configuration.

**Attack Vector:** Network-accessible HTTP requests with spoofed authentication headers.

**CWE Classification:** CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)

## Software Assessment (STEP 0)

### Network Reachability Assessment

**Is the software network-reachable?**
- **YES** - Kanboard is a web-based application that operates as a network-enabled service. It listens on network ports (typically 80/443) and processes HTTP/HTTPS requests.

**Is it often network-enabled?**
- **YES** - Web applications are inherently network-enabled. Kanboard's primary function is to provide web-based project management services accessible over the network.

**Network accessibility implications:**
- Network-reachable = Potential for external exploitation if instance is public-facing
- Web application architecture = Designed for network access

### Deployment Context Assessment

**What is the software's primary application?**
- **Public-Facing Web Application** - Kanboard is a project management software focused on Kanban methodology, designed as a web-based service for team collaboration and project tracking.

**Where is it typically deployed?**
- **Internet-Facing (Common)** - Project management software is often deployed as public-facing web applications accessible from the internet for team collaboration
- **LAN/Internal (Also Common)** - Some organizations deploy Kanboard on internal networks only
- **Cloud/Hosted** - Often deployed as self-hosted instances or cloud-hosted services
- **Hybrid Deployment** - Mix of public-facing and internal deployments

**Common deployment patterns:**
- **Public-Facing Deployment (Most Common for Project Management):** Exposed to internet for remote team access, accessible from public internet
- **Internal Network Deployment (Less Common):** Behind firewall, accessible only from LAN/VPN
- **Cloud-Hosted:** Deployed on cloud platforms with public endpoints

**Deployment Context Impact:**
- Project management software is **typically public-facing** to enable team collaboration
- Public-facing deployment = Higher kill chain utility for external attackers
- However, vulnerability requires `REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH` configuration to be enabled, which limits attack surface to configured instances

### Execution Context Assessment

**What privilege level does the software typically run as?**
- **Web Server User (Non-Root)** - Kanboard typically runs as a web server user (www-data, nginx, apache, or similar) with standard user privileges, not root/administrator
- **Application-Level Privileges** - The vulnerability provides application-level administrator privileges, not system-level root access

**Privilege escalation implications:**
- Application-level admin access enables complete control over Kanboard instance
- Does not directly provide system-level root access (requires additional vulnerabilities for system compromise)
- However, admin access to project management software can provide access to sensitive data and enable further attacks

**Execution environment:**
- **Web Server Environment** - Typically deployed on web servers (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM)
- **Containerized (Common)** - Often deployed in Docker containers
- **Cloud/Hosted** - Frequently deployed on cloud platforms
