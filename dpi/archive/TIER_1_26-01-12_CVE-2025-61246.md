## Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Apply Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all user-supplied data, especially the `proId` parameter
   - **Use Parameterized Queries:** Replace dynamic SQL with prepared statements:
     ```php
     // Secure implementation using prepared statements
     $proId = $_POST['proId'];
     $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ?");
     $stmt->bind_param("i", $proId);
     $stmt->execute();
     $result = $stmt->get_result();
     ```
   - **Update Application:** Apply security patches or migrate to a secure version
   - **Implement WAF Rules:** Deploy Web Application Firewall rules to block SQL injection attempts

2. **Detection and Monitoring:**
   - Monitor application logs for suspicious SQL injection patterns
   - Implement logging and alerting for abnormal query delays (time-based blind SQL injection indicator)
   - Monitor for unusual traffic to `review_action.php`, especially POST requests with crafted `proId` payloads
   - Detect anomalies: delayed responses, unusual SQL errors, strange timeouts, anomalous SELECT patterns

3. **Long-Term Measures:**
   - Conduct security audits to identify all SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Implement secure coding practices (OWASP Top 10 compliance)
   - Regular security testing and penetration testing
   - Consider migrating to actively maintained e-commerce platforms with strong security focus
