## Executive Summary

CVE-2026-24858 is an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel (CWE‑288) across multiple Fortinet products: FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiWeb. In affected versions, an attacker with a FortiCloud account and at least one registered device can abuse FortiCloud’s device registration mechanisms to log in to other FortiCloud-registered devices without possessing their local administrative credentials. This enables remote administrative access to firewalls, management consoles, and application security gateways that sit at the core of enterprise and critical infrastructure networks.

Although exploitation requires the attacker to control a FortiCloud account and a registered device, this precondition is realistic in scenarios where a device or FortiCloud account has already been compromised, or where supply-chain and hosting arrangements are weakly controlled. The attack delivers high-impact, cross-tenant, management-plane compromise and is therefore assessed as Tier 2: high value but barriered. Given Fortinet’s widespread deployment in Digital Public Infrastructure and enterprise perimeters, remediation priority is high.

Assessment Tier: TIER 2 (High Value but Barriered – Fortinet Management-Plane Auth Bypass)
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/dpi/T2/TIER_2_26-02-04_CVE-2026-24858.md
Rationale:
- Affects FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiWeb – core security and management platforms used in DPI and enterprise perimeters
- Allows an attacker with a FortiCloud account and a registered device to access other FortiCloud-registered devices without their local credentials
- Very high impact (full administrative control over multiple security devices), but requires prior compromise or misuse of FortiCloud/device registrations
- Suited to targeted campaigns, lateral movement, and supply-chain abuse rather than opportunistic scanning alone
Attractiveness Score: HIGH
DPI Relevance: DPI / Critical Network and Security Infrastructure

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Software and Deployment Context

- **Products affected (representative list):**
  - FortiAnalyzer 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.9, 7.2.0–7.2.11, 7.0.0–7.0.15
  - FortiManager 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.9, 7.2.0–7.2.11, 7.0.0–7.0.15
  - FortiOS 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.10, 7.2.0–7.2.12, 7.0.0–7.0.18
  - FortiProxy 7.6.0–7.6.4, 7.4.0–7.4.12, 7.2.0–7.2.15, 7.0.0–7.0.22
  - FortiWeb 8.0.0–8.0.3, 7.6.0–7.6.6, 7.4.0–7.4.11
- **Role:**
  - FortiAnalyzer/FortiManager: central logging, analytics, and configuration management
  - FortiOS/FortiProxy/FortiWeb: firewalls, secure web gateways, and web application firewalls
- **Deployment:**
  - Widely deployed at network edges and within core security infrastructure across enterprises and DPI operators
  - Often integrated with FortiCloud for centralised licensing, telemetry, and device management

The vulnerability lies in the interplay between FortiCloud and device authentication, not in a single product UI.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics

- **Root cause:** Inadequate separation and validation of FortiCloud registration state and local administrative authentication.
- **Behaviour (per advisory description):**
  - A FortiCloud user who has legitimately registered at least one device can, under certain conditions, leverage that registration relationship to log into other devices associated with the same FortiCloud account or asset pool, bypassing local access-control checks.
  - The affected devices treat successful FortiCloud-mediated access as sufficient proof of identity, without enforcing expected local checks or authorisation scopes.
- **Impact:**
  - Remote administrative access to multiple Fortinet devices through FortiCloud association alone
  - Potential lateral movement across tenants or device fleets where registration and access controls have been misconfigured or compromised.

This effectively converts FortiCloud into an unintended back channel for privileged access when misused or compromised.

### 3. Kill Chain Utility Assessment

**Initial access vs post-compromise**

- CVE-2026-24858 is most powerful **after** an attacker has:
  - Gained control over a FortiCloud account, or
  - Compromised a device that is FortiCloud-registered.
- It does not itself provide an internet-facing, unauthenticated entry point, but rather amplifies an existing FortiCloud or device foothold into many devices.

**Attacker gain**

- Once leveraged, the attacker can:
  - Log into other Fortinet devices as an administrator
  - Modify firewall, proxy, and WAF policies
  - Insert or modify routes, VPN settings, and logging destinations
  - Plant persistence mechanisms and covert exfiltration paths

In DPI and large enterprise environments, this can have systemic impact on network security posture.

**Barriers and reliability**

- Barriers:
  - Requires access to FortiCloud ecosystem and at least one registered device, typically after separate compromise or insider misuse.
  - Relies on specific version ranges and FortiCloud-enabled deployments.
- Reliability:
  - Once preconditions are met, the bypass is deterministic and well-suited to automation across fleets of devices.

These characteristics map to **Tier 2 – High Value but Barriered**: strong kill chain utility contingent on meaningful prerequisites.

### 4. Organisational and DPI Context

- **DPI and critical operators:**
  - Fortinet appliances are used broadly in government, financial services, healthcare, and telecoms to protect and segment critical networks.
  - A FortiCloud-based auth bypass jeopardises not just one device, but entire management domains.
- **Enterprises and SMEs:**
  - Even smaller organisations may rely on Fortinet devices as their only perimeter defence, making such a bypass particularly serious once an attacker gains a foothold.

Because of this, CVE-2026-24858 is assessed as DPI/infrastructure-relevant even though it requires pre-existing access to the FortiCloud ecosystem.

### 5. Recommended Mitigations

- **Patching and configuration:**
  - Upgrade all affected FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiWeb deployments to fixed versions as recommended by Fortinet.
  - Review and tighten FortiCloud registration policies and device associations.
- **FortiCloud account hygiene:**
  - Enforce strong authentication (including MFA) for FortiCloud accounts.
  - Limit FortiCloud account access to a minimal set of administrators.
  - Immediately rotate credentials and revoke suspect sessions if compromise is suspected.
- **Segmentation and access control:**
  - Ensure management interfaces for Fortinet devices are accessible only from tightly controlled admin networks or bastion hosts.
  - Avoid exposing device management ports directly to the internet even when FortiCloud is in use.

By closing this alternate authentication path and tightening management-plane exposure, organisations significantly reduce the kill chain utility of CVE-2026-24858.
