# Cyber Threat Observatory for national identity systems

The Turing Trustworthy Digital Infrastructure team has established a dedicated Cyber Threat Observatory to monitor and analyse threats in a timely way to empower identity system owners to be proactive in mitigating the increase in risks to the services that they offer.

The observatory serves as a central hub for gathering intelligence, identifying emerging threats, issuing early warnings, and disseminating insight and best practice to stakeholders. This observatory plays an important role in maintaining the security and integrity for any National Digital ID System.
