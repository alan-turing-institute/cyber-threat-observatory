## Executive Summary

CVE-2025-67261 is a content-based blind SQL injection vulnerability in Abacre Retail Point of Sale 14.0.0.396, located in the `Search` function of the Orders page. An unauthenticated (or low-privileged) user who can reach this search interface can craft queries that alter the underlying SQL, allowing enumeration of tables and data in the Firebird database backing the POS. Public exploit material shows how attackers confirm table existence and row counts using only response content, enabling gradual extraction of business and customer data without triggering obvious errors.

From a kill chain economics viewpoint, this vulnerability offers **network-accessible data-layer compromise** with low technical complexity but within what is typically an internal or VPN-restricted POS environment. Once an attacker has network access to the POS UI (through misconfiguration, VPN compromise, or insider presence), this SQL injection becomes a high-value tool for data theft and internal pivoting. However, because the application is not usually exposed directly to the public internet, and exploitation requires line-of-business context, it fits best as a high-value but barriered vector rather than an immediate, internet-scale threat.

Assessment Tier: TIER 2 (High Value but Barriered – Internal Data-Layer Compromise)
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/generic/T2/TIER_2_26-02-04_CVE-2025-67261.md
Rationale:
- Blind SQL injection with no authentication requirement in the Orders search function, enabling systematic extraction of data from the POS database
- Exploitation is automatable and supported by detailed PoCs, lowering attacker effort once network access to the POS UI is obtained
- Typical deployments are LAN/VPN-only; external attackers must first overcome network or VPN barriers, but insiders or post-compromise actors can readily exploit it
- Impact on data confidentiality and integrity is significant, justifying Tier 2 for environments where the POS application is reachable
Attractiveness Score: MEDIUM–HIGH (Internal/VPN Context)
DPI Relevance: Not DPI-Specific (Retail Business Application)

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Software and Deployment Context

- **Software:** Abacre Retail Point of Sale 14.0.0.396
- **Role:** Retail POS system for order and client management
- **Typical deployment:**
  - Installed on-premises within store or back-office networks
  - Accessed via desktop or browser-based UI by cashiers and administrative staff
- **Network reachability:**
  - Commonly bound to LAN or VPN segments, not directly internet-facing
  - Misconfigurations, exposed RDP/VPN, or cloud-hosted instances can widen exposure

The vulnerable Orders search function sits at the application front-end layer but has a direct conduit to the backend Firebird database.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics

- **Root cause:** The search parameter in the Orders module is concatenated into SQL queries without parameterisation or proper escaping.
- **Exploit pattern (per PoC):**
  - Initial confirmation:
    - Injecting payloads like `') OR EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM Client)--` into the search field to test for true/false responses.
  - Data enumeration:
    - Using row-count checks such as `') OR (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Client)=4--` and observing whether search results change.
  - This enables classic content-based blind inference of:
    - Table existence
    - Row counts
    - Potentially, data values via more complex predicates.
- **Impact:** Attackers can read and potentially modify data in core POS tables, including:
  - Client details
  - Order history
  - Other business-critical records

### 3. Kill Chain Utility Assessment

**Initial access vs post-compromise**

- The vulnerability behaves as an **unauthenticated remote injection** once an attacker can reach the Orders search UI.
- However, in typical deployments:
  - The Orders UI is only reachable from internal networks or over organisation-controlled VPNs.
  - Achieving that network position is itself a non-trivial prerequisite (VPN compromise, insider, or prior foothold).

**Attacker gain**

- **Confidentiality and integrity:** Access to and manipulation of retail data (orders, clients, inventory) can:
  - Expose customer PII
  - Undermine financial and operational accuracy
  - Facilitate fraud
- **Pivoting:** Database-level knowledge and write access can support:
  - Creation of backdoor accounts or logic bombs in application data
  - Staging of further exploits if application code trusts database content

**Barriers and reliability**

- Technical exploitation is straightforward and demonstrated in public tooling; blind SQL inference is slower than error-based injection but stable.
- The primary barrier is **network reachability**: this is not a generic internet-scan target, but highly valuable once an attacker is on the right segment.

In the WAA framework, this aligns with **Tier 2 – High Value but Barriered**: strong data-layer gains behind a realistic but non-trivial network barrier.

### 4. Organisational Context and DPI Relevance

- **DPI / critical infrastructure:** This CVE affects retail POS deployments and does not directly touch digital public infrastructure.
- **SME and retail chain environments:**
  - Particularly relevant where POS systems are flatly networked with office systems or reachable from guest/Wi-Fi segments.
  - Breach of POS data can still have regulatory and reputational consequences.
- **DPI classification:** Not DPI-specific – categorised under generic enterprise/retail infrastructure.

For organisations where POS networks are reachable from broader corporate environments, this vulnerability can meaningfully amplify the impact of an initial foothold.

### 5. Exploit Availability and Threat Signals

- **PoC status:** GitHub and Packet Storm advisories provide:
  - Confirmed payloads
  - Screenshots and step-by-step guidance on exploiting the blind SQL channel
- **EPSS:** Low-to-moderate, reflecting internal deployment bias and limited telemetry.
- **In-the-wild indicators:** No large-scale campaigns reported, but the pattern matches typical targeted abuse of misconfigured or exposed POS environments.

Adversaries focused on retail compromise can cheaply add this to their toolkit once they identify vulnerable Abacre instances.

### 6. Recommended Mitigations

- **Application fixes:**
  - Refactor query construction to use parameterised statements and ORM features.
  - Rigorously validate and constrain search input (length, allowed character sets, patterns).
- **Deployment and access controls:**
  - Ensure POS management and Orders UIs are:
    - Not exposed directly to the public internet
    - Accessible only from trusted subnets or via strong VPN with MFA
  - Segment POS networks from general office and guest networks.
- **Monitoring and detection:**
  - Log and alert on anomalous search patterns such as:
    - Excessive special characters
    - Repeated similar queries with incremental numeric changes
  - Monitor for unexpected database errors or performance anomalies during search operations.

These mitigations raise both the effort and risk of exploitation, reducing the practical attractiveness of CVE-2025-67261 while longer-term remediation is deployed.
