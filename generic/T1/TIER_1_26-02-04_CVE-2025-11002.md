## Executive Summary

CVE-2025-11002 is a directory traversal and remote code execution vulnerability in 7‑Zip’s ZIP file parsing logic, affecting installations that process attacker-supplied ZIP archives. By abusing how 7‑Zip handles symbolic links and path traversal within ZIP files, an attacker can cause extracted content to escape intended directories and overwrite or place files in arbitrary locations. In realistic deployments—such as services or scheduled tasks that automatically unpack archives and execute contained binaries or scripts—this can be chained to execute attacker-controlled code in the context of a service account.

Exploitation requires user or system interaction with a malicious ZIP (for example, a helpdesk processing attachments, a file-ingest pipeline, or a backup/restore workflow), so it is not a classic “single-packet” remote exploit. However, 7‑Zip is ubiquitous across endpoints and servers, and many automated workflows implicitly trust extracted content. From a Kill Chain Economics perspective, this vulnerability offers high potential impact for targeted campaigns and supply-chain style compromises where ZIP archives are routinely exchanged and processed, especially in environments that run extraction under elevated accounts.

Assessment Tier: TIER 2 (High Value but Barriered – Interaction-Dependent RCE)
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/generic/T2/TIER_2_26-02-04_CVE-2025-11002.md
Rationale:
- Enables code execution via crafted ZIP archives that abuse symlink and traversal handling to escape extraction directories
- Requires user or automated system interaction with malicious archives; suitable for phishing, file-ingest, or supply-chain attack paths rather than unauthenticated network-only scanning
- Impact can be severe when extraction runs under service or administrative accounts in batch or backend workflows
- High attacker gain but non-trivial delivery and social/operational prerequisites justify Tier 2 classification
Attractiveness Score: MEDIUM–HIGH (Targeted / Supply-Chain Context)
DPI Relevance: General Infrastructure (Endpoint and File-Processing Tooling)

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Software and Deployment Context

- **Software:** 7‑Zip – widely used file archiver on Windows and other platforms
- **Role:** Desktop and server-side archive extraction, often integrated into:
  - User workflows (manual unzipping of email attachments and downloads)
  - Automated jobs (backup/restore, ETL, ingestion of customer-provided archives)
- **Typical deployment:**
  - Installed on workstations, application servers, and batch-processing hosts
  - Sometimes invoked by scripts or services without explicit user confirmation

Because 7‑Zip is not itself a network service, its attack surface is driven by where and how archives are sourced and processed.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics

- **Root cause:** Insufficient enforcement of directory boundaries when extracting ZIP archives that contain symbolic links or crafted path entries.
- **Vulnerable behaviour:**
  - Malicious ZIP entries with symlinks and traversal segments (e.g. `../../Windows/Tasks/`) allow files to be written outside the intended extraction directory.
  - When 7‑Zip honours such entries during extraction, attacker-controlled payloads can land in:
    - System or application directories
    - Locations that are later executed or loaded by scheduled tasks or services.
- **Impact path (per ZDI description):**
  1. Victim or automated system opens/extracts a crafted ZIP with 7‑Zip.
  2. Extraction writes or overwrites files in unintended directories via symlink/traversal abuse.
  3. A subsequent action—automatic execution, service restart, or user double-click—runs the attacker’s code under a service account context.

The vulnerability thus provides a strong primitive (arbitrary file placement) that can be chained into RCE depending on environment.

### 3. Kill Chain Utility Assessment

**Initial access vs post-compromise**

- CVE‑2025‑11002 is not a direct network-entry vulnerability; it is best viewed as:
  - A delivery-stage or execution-stage tool embedded in phishing, malspam, or B2B file-sharing campaigns
  - A supply-chain weapon against organisations that process third-party ZIPs in automated jobs

**Attacker gain**

- **When chained correctly:**
  - Remote code execution as the user or service running 7‑Zip
  - Potential overwrite of critical scripts, DLLs, or configuration files to yield persistent control
  - Subversion of software update or backup processes
- **Economics:**
  - 7‑Zip’s ubiquity makes targeting rewarding, but success depends heavily on workflow specifics; attackers must identify where archives are processed in a way that leads to code execution.

**Barriers and complexity**

- Requires:
  - Delivery of a malicious ZIP to a victim or automated system
  - Successful convincing of a user or process to extract it with affected 7‑Zip logic
  - A viable code-execution chokepoint (e.g. overwritten scripts, scheduled tasks)
- These prerequisites are realistic in targeted campaigns but reduce suitability for opportunistic, unauthenticated scanning relative to pure network RCEs.

Within Kill Chain Economics this aligns well with **Tier 2 – High Value but Barriered**, particularly for environments with automated extraction under elevated accounts.

### 4. Organisational and DPI Context

- **DPI / critical infrastructure:** 7‑Zip may exist on systems within DPI operators (e.g. admin workstations, data-ingest servers), but it is a generic tool rather than a DPI-specific platform.
- **Enterprise and SME environments:** High relevance where:
  - Operational teams routinely unpack ZIP attachments
  - Back-office or data-processing servers automatically consume ZIPs from partners or customers
- **DPI relevance classification:** General Infrastructure – risk is significant but mediated through local workflows, not a direct threat to core DPI control planes.

Analysts should pay particular attention to servers and scheduled jobs that run 7‑Zip as a privileged service account.

### 5. Exploit Availability and Threat Signals

- **ZDI origin:** The issue was discovered and documented by the Zero Day Initiative, indicating mature exploitability and likely proof-of-concept implementations.
- **EPSS and ecosystem signals:** As a client-side/tooling vulnerability, EPSS may understate risk in high-value environments compared with network service CVEs.
- **Historical context:** Similar archive-handling flaws have been weaponised in targeted attacks and red-team tradecraft, especially where automatic unpacking is part of ingestion workflows.

The combination of a powerful primitive and widespread deployment ensures CVE‑2025‑11002 will be of interest to advanced attackers despite its interaction dependencies.

### 6. Recommended Mitigations

- **Patch and configuration:**
  - Upgrade 7‑Zip to a version that corrects directory traversal and symlink handling in ZIP parsing.
  - Where possible, disable or tightly control symlink extraction and enforce extraction into dedicated, non-privileged directories.
- **Workflow hardening:**
  - Avoid running 7‑Zip under high-privilege service accounts; use dedicated, least-privilege identities.
  - For automated jobs, restrict acceptable archive formats and validate archive structure before extraction.
  - Consider using sandboxed containers or isolated hosts for processing untrusted ZIPs.
- **User and process controls:**
  - Educate users handling ZIP files from external sources about the risk of opening archives on sensitive systems.
  - Deploy endpoint protections capable of detecting abnormal file writes and suspicious child processes following archive extraction.

These measures raise attacker effort and reduce the likelihood that a single crafted ZIP will translate into reliable RCE in production environments.
