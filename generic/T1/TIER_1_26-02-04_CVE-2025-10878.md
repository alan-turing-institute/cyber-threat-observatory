Executive Summary
Impact and likelihood:
- **Public internet exposure:** If the AdminPando `/admin/logIn.php` interface is reachable from the public internet, this vulnerability enables unauthenticated attackers to gain full administrative control of the site with a single SQL injection payload. Likely impact includes complete website takeover, malicious content delivery to visitors, and potential access to any data handled by the application. Likelihood of exploitation is **high** given the trivial payload and a public proof-of-concept.
- **Behind a firewall/VPN:** If the admin interface is only reachable from an internal network or via VPN, the vulnerability primarily benefits internal adversaries or actors with stolen VPN credentials. External risk is then tied to the likelihood of network access compromise; impact remains high for the affected site, but the attack surface is reduced.

Brief description of the vulnerability:
CVE-2025-10878 is a SQL injection flaw in the login functionality of Fikir Odalari AdminPando 1.0.1. The `username` and `password` parameters accept unsanitised input, allowing a payload such as `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication entirely and grant full access to the admin dashboard, from which an attacker can manipulate all public-facing website content.

Assessment Tier: **TIER 1 (Immediate – External Initial Access)**
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/generic/T1/TIER_1_26-02-04_CVE-2025-10878.md
Vulners reference: https://vulners.com/cve/CVE-2025-10878

Rationale:
- No authentication, user interaction, or special configuration is required on a typical internet-facing deployment; the attack is a single low-entropy SQL payload.
- Successful exploitation yields full administrative control over site content and potentially any data exposed via the application, making it a high-gain initial access vector.
- A public GitHub proof-of-concept and third-party write-ups confirm exploitability and provide step-by-step instructions with screenshots.
- Observed sightings in external feeds (via CIRCL/Attackerkb) show early awareness and discussion, increasing the chance of scanning and opportunistic abuse where the software is deployed.
- Attractiveness Score: **HIGH** for organisations actually running internet-exposed AdminPando instances (negligible elsewhere due to limited deployment).
- DPI Relevance: **General Infrastructure (non-DPI web property)** – affects a vendor-specific corporate CMS rather than core digital public infrastructure such as identity, payments, or national-scale government platforms.

In-Depth Kill Chain Utility Analysis

1. Software Assessment
- **Product and vendor:** Fikir Odalari AdminPando 1.0.1 by Insaat / Omran İnşaat A.Ş., used as a web-based administration panel for a corporate website.
- **Network reachability:** The vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/logIn.php`) is an HTTP(S) login page, accessible over the network. The proof-of-concept targets a live URL on `www.omran.com.tr`, demonstrating real-world internet exposure.
- **Deployment context:** Designed as a public-facing admin login for site operators. In many practical deployments this will be exposed on the same domain as the main website, sometimes protected only by obscurity or weak access controls.
- **Execution context:** The vulnerability sits at the application layer but grants full administrative privileges within the web application. Depending on the application’s capabilities, this may include viewing or editing stored data, managing users, and modifying any HTML/DOM served to visitors.

2. Vulnerability Mechanics
- **Root cause:** Unsanitised `username` and `password` parameters in the login query, leading to classic authentication-bypass SQL injection (CWE-89).
- **Exploit pattern:** A trivial payload such as `' OR '1'='1` in either field causes the underlying SQL query to evaluate as true, bypassing credential checks.
- **Resulting access:** The attacker is logged in as an administrative user and can use the dashboard as if legitimately authenticated, with full control over site content and any admin-only functions.

3. Kill Chain Position and Barriers
- **Stage:** External **initial access** to the application. The attacker moves directly from unauthenticated internet user to authenticated admin of the web application in a single request.
- **Barriers/prerequisites:**
  - No prior credentials required (PR:N).
  - No user interaction (UI:N).
  - No need for network-level man-in-the-middle position or special routing.
  - No high-complexity exploitation steps: the PoC demonstrates copy‑paste payloads from a browser form.
- **Reliability:** The GitHub PoC and write-up provide clear, reproducible steps with screenshots; the exploit is deterministic under default conditions and does not depend on race conditions, memory layout, or rare configurations.

Given this, the attack path is “internet → vulnerable login page → full admin session” with no meaningful friction, which is the archetype of a Tier 1, high-utility initial access vector for any organisation that deploys this software publicly.

4. Attacker Effort vs Gain
- **Effort (low):**
  - Discovery of `/admin` can be automated via directory brute forcing or standard tooling.
  - The payload is a textbook SQL authentication bypass, trivial to use by even low-skilled adversaries.
  - Public documentation (GitHub PoC and blog post) removes the need for bespoke research.
- **Gain (high for affected sites):**
  - Full control over public-facing content enables defacement, brand damage, and malicious script injection (e.g., phishing pages, credential collection from visitors, or malware distribution).
  - Administrative access may reveal user data or internal configuration depending on what the CMS stores or integrates with.
  - The admin panel could provide secondary pivots (e.g., file upload, configuration editors) that may expose underlying server paths or enable further compromise, though these depend on installation-specific features and are not guaranteed.

Under the kill chain utility formula (low effort × high gain), this strongly supports a **TIER 1** classification for environments where AdminPando is deployed and network-exposed.

5. Evidence and Exploit Availability
- **Public PoC:** The GitHub repository `onurcangnc/CVE-2025-10878-AdminPandov1.0.1-SQLi` contains a detailed proof-of-concept, technical description, and step-by-step attack flow, including payloads and screenshots. While it is not an automated exploit script, the actions are so simple that the barrier to weaponisation is effectively negligible.
- **Threat intelligence signals:**
  - Entries on platforms such as Attackerkb mirror the technical description and confirm community interest.
  - CIRCL sightings show references from social media, indicating early dissemination across security and threat-intel channels.
- **EPSS:** No explicit EPSS score is present in the Vulners record at the time of analysis, but the combination of trivial exploit mechanics and public exposure suggests EPSS is likely to rise once model data is updated.

Taken together, these signals confirm that adversaries have all the information needed to exploit the vulnerability quickly wherever the software is deployed.

6. Deployment Scenarios and Organisational Context
- **Internet-exposed admin panel (common for small organisations):**
  - For small or mid-sized enterprises using AdminPando directly on their main domain, exposure of `/admin/logIn.php` to the public internet creates an immediate external attack path.
  - In this scenario, a single request can compromise the branding, content, and potentially user data of the entire site.
  - This justifies **TIER 1 (Immediate)** for any organisation known to run vulnerable versions on a publicly accessible endpoint.
- **Behind firewall/VPN only:**
  - Where best practice is followed and the admin interface is bound to an internal network or VPN, exploitation requires prior network access or credential theft for VPN accounts.
  - The vulnerability remains dangerous for post-compromise or insider scenarios but loses its value as an external initial access vector.
  - In such environments, the same technical flaw behaves more like a high-impact post-compromise tool, but given its ability to quickly escalate internal presence and manipulate public content, it would still warrant at least **TIER 2–3** in a local risk register.

7. Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Relevance
- **System role:** AdminPando, as described in the public PoC and Vulners record, is a bespoke or vendor-specific CMS for a single corporate website (`omran.com.tr`). It is not documented as a widely deployed national platform, financial core system, identity provider, or other DPI component.
- **Cross-sector impact:** Compromise of an individual corporate site can cause reputational harm and expose visitors to malicious content but does not, on current evidence, present systemic risk to payments, national identity systems, or critical government services.
- **Classification:** For the Observatory’s purposes, this CVE is best treated as **General Infrastructure (non-DPI web property)** rather than a DPI, infrastructure, or large-enterprise core platform issue.

8. Overall Attractiveness Assessment
- **For organisations running AdminPando 1.0.1 on public internet endpoints:**
  - Attractiveness to attackers is **HIGH**: immediate external initial access, trivial exploitation, and full application compromise with strong follow-on options (defacement, malicious content injection, potential data exposure).
- **For the broader ecosystem:**
  - Attractiveness is constrained by the limited and vendor-specific deployment footprint. This is unlikely to become a “wormable” or mass-exploitation campaign targeting thousands of organisations simultaneously, but it is very attractive for targeted attacks against any site known to use this product.

In summary, CVE-2025-10878 is a textbook example of a critical, low-effort, high-gain web application flaw. It deserves **TIER 1** treatment for any environment confirmed to run vulnerable AdminPando instances on reachable endpoints, while remaining outside the core DPI vulnerability set due to its narrow deployment scope.
