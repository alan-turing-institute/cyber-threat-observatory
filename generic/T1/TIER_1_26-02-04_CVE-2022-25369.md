## Executive Summary

CVE-2022-25369 is an unauthenticated administrator-creation vulnerability in Dynamicweb (prior to 9.12.8) that allows a remote attacker to re-run the product’s setup phases and add a new administrative user without prior authentication. Once this attacker-controlled admin account is created, they can log into the CMS, upload executable files, and ultimately achieve remote code execution on the underlying web server. As Dynamicweb is commonly deployed as an internet-facing e‑commerce and CMS platform, this flaw provides a direct, scriptable path to full site and server compromise from the public internet.

From a Kill Chain Economics viewpoint, this is classic Tier 1: a low-complexity, unauthenticated vulnerability on a public web application that yields administrative control and, with trivial follow-on actions, code execution. Public advisories and exploit writeups further reduce attacker fixed costs. Dynamicweb instances forming part of customer-facing portals, e‑commerce systems, or public-sector sites should treat this as an immediate, high-priority risk.

Assessment Tier: TIER 1 (Immediate – Unauthenticated Admin Creation and RCE on Public CMS)
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/generic/T1/TIER_1_26-02-04_CVE-2022-25369.md
Rationale:
- Logic flaw in setup-phase handling allows unauthenticated creation of new administrative users on live sites
- Newly created admin accounts can upload executables and run arbitrary code via CMS features
- Dynamicweb is typically internet-facing; exploitation requires only network access and minimal technical skill
- High attacker gain (site takeover, data theft, webshell deployment) with very low effort makes this highly attractive for mass and targeted exploitation
Attractiveness Score: VERY HIGH
DPI Relevance: General Infrastructure (Public Web / E‑Commerce)

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Software and Deployment Context

- **Software:** Dynamicweb CMS and e‑commerce platform
- **Role:** Powers public websites, online shops, and content management back-ends
- **Typical deployment:**
  - Internet-facing web servers in DMZs or cloud environments
  - Integrated with payment, CRM, and back-office systems

Because it is designed as a front-end platform, Dynamicweb is often directly exposed to untrusted internet traffic.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics

- **Root cause:** Logic flaw in determining whether the product’s setup wizard can be re-run on an already-initialised instance.
- **Exploit pattern (per advisories and research):**
  1. Attacker issues crafted HTTP requests that trigger the setup phase logic on a production instance.
  2. Due to inadequate state validation, the application permits creation of a new administrative user as if it were a fresh installation.
  3. The attacker logs into the CMS with the newly created admin credentials.
  4. Using standard CMS functionality (e.g. file upload, template editing), they upload executable content (webshells, malicious scripts) and achieve RCE.
- **Impact:**
  - Full administrative control of the CMS and its content
  - Potential remote code execution under the web server’s account
  - Access to customer data, order information, and integrated backend systems

This is a pure authentication/authorisation bypass at the highest privilege level.

### 3. Kill Chain Utility Assessment

**Initial access**

- CVE-2022-25369 directly supports **unauthenticated initial access**:
  - No prior credentials or foothold are required.
  - The vulnerability is reachable via normal HTTP/S traffic to the site.

**Attacker gain**

- Once exploited, attackers can:
  - Deface or replace site content
  - Steal or manipulate customer and transaction data
  - Deploy persistent webshells and pivot deeper into the hosting environment
- For e‑commerce and customer portals, this can translate into substantial financial and reputational damage.

**Barriers and reliability**

- Low complexity; exploitation is essentially a crafted sequence of HTTP requests emulating setup.
- The main limiting factor is version coverage: only Dynamicweb instances that have not been updated to 9.12.8+ or later fixed releases remain vulnerable.

Given these properties, the vulnerability fits cleanly into **Tier 1 – Immediate**, especially for exposed production sites.

### 4. Organisational Context and DPI Relevance

- **Enterprises and SMEs:** High risk where Dynamicweb powers core revenue-generating sites or customer portals.
- **Public sector / DPI-adjacent:** Where Dynamicweb is used for official communication or service portals, compromise undermines trust, enables phishing, and may provide entry into backend systems.
- **DPI classification:** While not a DPI core platform, Dynamicweb underpins important public-facing infrastructure and is treated here as general, rather than narrowly DPI-specific, infrastructure.

Any organisation exposing a Dynamicweb instance should assume that mass scanning and opportunistic exploitation are feasible.

### 5. Exploit Availability and Threat Signals

- **Public discussion:** Vulners enrichment and related advisories indicate clear exploitability via the web setup flow.
- **Exploitability:** Creating an admin account via exposed setup endpoints is typically straightforward, and weaponising this into RCE via file upload is trivial for any attacker familiar with webshells.
- **EPSS and telemetry:** As an older CVE, active exploitation may already have occurred; older unpatched instances remain prime targets.

Given the sustained attractiveness of CMS admin-bypass issues in both cybercrime and targeted operations, this CVE should be assumed to be within reach of commodity actors.

### 6. Recommended Mitigations

- **Patch and configuration:**
  - Upgrade Dynamicweb to **9.12.8, 9.13.0 or later** where the setup-phase logic has been corrected.
  - Ensure that setup and installation endpoints are disabled or removed on production instances.
- **Hardening:**
  - Enforce strict separation of duties and restrict administrative access (IP allowlists, VPN-only access).
  - Disable arbitrary file upload and script execution where not strictly required.
- **Monitoring and response:**
  - Review admin user lists for unknown or suspicious accounts and reset credentials.
  - Inspect webroot and application directories for unauthorised files or webshells.
  - Monitor HTTP logs for repeated setup-related requests on production systems.

These measures both close the primary exploit path and help detect and remediate any prior compromise stemming from CVE-2022-25369.
