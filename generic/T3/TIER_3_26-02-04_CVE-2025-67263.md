## Executive Summary

CVE-2025-67263 is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Abacre Retail Point of Sale 14.0.0.396, where the Clients module fails to sanitise user-controlled `Name` and `Surname` fields. An attacker who can create or modify client records can inject JavaScript that is later executed in the browser of any user who views generated statements, including staff operating the POS back office. The vulnerability enables session theft, UI redressing, or injection of malicious content into back-office views, but does not directly provide server-side code execution or database compromise.

From a kill chain economics standpoint, this is a **client-side, authenticated, workflow-triggered issue**: it requires some form of access to the POS client management interface and relies on staff subsequently generating statements to render the payload. The impact is bounded to the browser context and business portal, with no direct path to infrastructure control. Despite public PoCs and low technical complexity, the combination of authentication, user interaction, and limited impact places this in the arsenal category rather than an immediate, high-priority initial-access vector.

Assessment Tier: TIER 3 (Arsenal Value – Authenticated Client-Side Attack)
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/generic/T3/TIER_3_26-02-04_CVE-2025-67263.md
Rationale:
- Stored XSS in an internal business application; exploitation typically requires authenticated access to create or edit client records
- Payload executes only when staff generate or view statements, introducing user-interaction and workflow dependence
- Impact is client-side (session hijacking, UI manipulation, phishing) rather than direct RCE or data-layer compromise
- Public PoC exists but barriers plus low-impact gain make it better suited to post-compromise abuse than as a primary entry point
Attractiveness Score: LOW–MEDIUM
DPI Relevance: Not DPI-Specific (Retail Business Application)

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Software and Deployment Context

- **Software:** Abacre Retail Point of Sale (POS) 14.0.0.396
- **Role:** Retail POS application used to manage orders, clients, and statements; typically deployed within shop, franchise, or small retail environments
- **Typical deployment:**
  - Internal business networks, often on back-office workstations or local servers
  - Access primarily by staff with authenticated accounts
- **Network reachability:**
  - In many deployments the management UI is LAN-only or even single-host; internet exposure is possible but not the default
- **Execution context:**
  - Vulnerability affects the web UI rendered in staff browsers, not the server executable directly

This places the affected surface in the internal business application layer, not in internet-facing DPI or infrastructure components.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics

- **Root cause:** The application stores unsanitised values from the `Name` and `Surname` fields in the Clients module and later reuses them in HTML without proper escaping.
- **Exploit pattern:**
  1. An attacker with the ability to create or edit a client record sets `Name` or `Surname` to a payload such as `<script>alert('xss')</script>`.
  2. The record is saved; the payload is persisted in the database.
  3. When staff later generate a statement for that client, the rendered preview page includes the stored script, which executes in their browser.
- **Impact:** Stored XSS in the context of the Abacre POS UI:
  - Stealing session cookies or tokens (if not otherwise protected)
  - Injecting phishing content or fake prompts to harvest credentials
  - Manipulating visible data or triggering client-side actions

### 3. Kill Chain Utility Assessment

**Initial access vs post-compromise**

- Exploitation assumes the adversary can:
  - Authenticate into the POS application (as a staff user), or
  - Compromise a staff account or machine to manipulate client records
- The vulnerability is therefore not an unauthenticated external entry point; it is more realistically a **post-compromise enhancement** to extend control over other operator sessions.

**Attacker gain**

- Provides leverage within the bounds of the POS web UI:
  - Lateral movement between staff accounts via session hijacking or credential theft
  - Business logic abuse (e.g. manipulating what staff see in generated statements)
- Does **not** directly yield:
  - Server OS-level code execution
  - Arbitrary SQL queries beyond what the app already performs
  - Network-level pivoting

**Barriers and reliability**

- Technical exploitation is straightforward once data entry is possible; stored XSS triggers reliably when statements are generated.
- However, the barriers of authentication and workflow dependence (staff needing to run the statement function) reduce suitability for mass, opportunistic campaigns.

Following the Kill Chain Economics framework, this maps cleanly to **Category M1: Client-Side Only / Phishing Facilitation with Barriers** and **Category D2: LAN/Internal-only deployment**, supporting a Tier 3 classification.

### 4. Organisational Context and DPI Relevance

- **DPI / critical infrastructure:** Not specific to DPI; affects retail POS deployments in commercial environments.
- **SME / retail chains:** Likely to be deployed in small or mid-sized environments with limited segmentation between POS and office networks, but still behind firewalls and VPNs.
- **DPI classification:** Not DPI-specific – this is a generic retail business application issue.

While compromise of POS environments can have real financial and privacy impact, this particular vulnerability does not by itself grant direct access to payment infrastructure or national-scale DPI.

### 5. Exploit Availability and Threat Signals

- **PoC status:** Public exploit and Packet Storm advisory document the payload and trigger path in detail.
- **EPSS:** Low EPSS score, matching a client-side, internal-UI-focused vulnerability.
- **In-the-wild indicators:** No specific evidence of widespread exploitation beyond research disclosures.

Public PoC reduces development cost, but given the need for access to a running POS instance and accounts, this remains a niche tool in adversary arsenals rather than a primary scanning target.

### 6. Recommended Mitigations

- **Application fixes:**
  - Apply vendor patches that ensure all user-supplied fields are HTML-encoded on output.
  - Validate and sanitise the `Name`, `Surname`, and similar fields server-side to strip or neutralise script content.
- **Deployment and operational controls:**
  - Restrict POS management interfaces to trusted internal networks or VPNs.
  - Enforce strong authentication and role separation for staff accounts.
  - Encourage staff to report unexpected pop-ups or UI behaviour when viewing statements.
- **Compensating controls:**
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in POS web frontends where feasible to reduce XSS impact.
  - Monitor POS backend logs for anomalous client data patterns that may indicate injection attempts.

These steps meaningfully reduce both the likelihood and utility of exploiting CVE-2025-67263 while broader hardening work on POS environments continues.
