## Executive Summary

CVE-2025-67264 is an OS command injection vulnerability in the `com.sprd.engineermode` component on Doogee Note59, Note59 Pro, and Note59 Pro+ devices. By abusing the EngineerMode ADB shell and incomplete fixes for CVE-2025-31710, a local attacker with low privileges can execute arbitrary commands and escalate to a root shell via trusted access to the `cmd_skt` abstract socket. This provides full control of the affected handset but does not introduce a new remote network attack surface: the adversary must already be able to run commands locally or via ADB.

In the Work-Averse Attacker model, this is a powerful **post-compromise privilege escalation tool** for Android malware, exploit chains, and physical attackers, but it is not an initial-access vector by itself. Exploitation requires prior control of the device or ADB-level access, and the scope of compromise is limited to the handset rather than broader infrastructure. Accordingly, it is best classified as Tier 3 “arsenal value”: high utility in multi-stage attacks, but dependent on an existing foothold on the device.

Assessment Tier: TIER 3 (Arsenal Value – Local Privilege Escalation on Handsets)
Full analysis: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/cyber-threat-observatory/blob/main/generic/T3/TIER_3_26-02-04_CVE-2025-67264.md
Rationale:
- Enables local attackers or malware to escalate to root on certain Doogee Note59 family devices via EngineerMode and `cmd_skt`
- No direct remote exploitation; requires prior ADB access or the ability to execute code on the handset
- High impact on device confidentiality and integrity, but limited to endpoints rather than networked infrastructure
- Valuable as part of exploit chains or persistence on compromised devices, not as a standalone perimeter threat
Attractiveness Score: MEDIUM
DPI Relevance: Not DPI-Specific (Mobile Endpoint Privilege Escalation)

## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Software and Deployment Context

- **Platform:** Unisoc-based Android devices (Doogee Note59, Note59 Pro, Note59 Pro+)
- **Component:** `com.sprd.engineermode` (EngineerMode), a vendor diagnostic and engineering application
- **Role:** Provides low-level diagnostic and configuration capabilities; treated as a trusted client by the `cmd_skt`/`cmd_services` root service
- **Exposure:**
  - EngineerMode is not intended for general user access but can be enabled via secret dialer codes or vendor tooling.
  - ADB or debugging access to the handset is required to reliably trigger the exploit path in most scenarios.

The affected component is a **local privileged tool** on Android rather than a network-facing service.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics

- **Root cause:** Incomplete patching of earlier command injection in EngineerMode (CVE-2025-31710), leaving code paths that still pass unsanitised input into privileged commands.
- **Exploit pattern (per public PoCs):**
  1. Attacker or malware enables EngineerMode on the device (e.g. via a dialer code or script).
  2. Using ADB, Shizuku, or app-level access, they invoke EngineerMode activities that connect to the `cmd_skt` abstract socket, which is serviced by a root-level `cmd_services`/`tool_service` process.
  3. Crafted commands are sent through this channel, which are executed with root privileges on the device.
  4. The attacker establishes a root shell and can then disable security controls, install backdoors, or modify system partitions where SELinux and firmware design permit.
- **Impact:**
  - Full compromise of the handset, including data, apps, system configuration, and potentially baseband-adjacent functionality, depending on what `cmd_services` can reach.

### 3. Kill Chain Utility Assessment

**Initial access vs post-compromise**

- The vulnerability does **not** provide a remote, unauthenticated path into the device:
  - It requires existing code execution on the handset (malware, app exploit) or physical/ADB access.
  - It therefore acts as a **local privilege escalation** stage within a broader attack chain.

**Attacker gain**

- Once leveraged, CVE-2025-67264 significantly upgrades an attacker’s capabilities on the device:
  - Persistent root access
  - Ability to subvert security controls, implant rootkits, and exfiltrate or tamper with sensitive data
  - Potential to install additional tooling to attack nearby networks from the handset

**Barriers and reliability**

- Barriers:
  - Pre-existing foothold or ADB-level access is mandatory.
  - Exploit procedures may require timing around `cmd_services` startup and tight coordination between client and socket.
- Reliability:
  - Public tooling and detailed writeups (e.g. unisoc-su) show that, once preconditions are met, exploitation is repeatable across supported firmware versions.

In Kill Chain Economics terms, this is high-value **arsenal** for actors who routinely gain app-level access on target devices, but it offers no new low-cost initial access path.

### 4. Organisational Context and DPI Relevance

- **End-user devices:** The primary impact is on individual users’ privacy and device integrity.
- **Enterprise / MDM-managed fleets:** In BYOD or corporately managed environments, root compromise of a handset can:
  - Undermine MDM policies
  - Provide an attacker with a foothold inside corporate networks via VPNs and apps
- **DPI / critical infrastructure:** While compromised endpoints can be staging points, the vulnerability itself does not directly affect core DPI components.

For most organisations, this CVE should inform mobile hardening and EDR policies rather than be treated as a top-tier perimeter emergency.

### 5. Exploit Availability and Threat Signals

- **Public tooling:** The `unisoc-su` toolkit and associated documentation provide:
  - Ready-made scripts for obtaining root via EngineerMode and `cmd_skt`
  - Step-by-step exploitation procedures and post-exploitation techniques (e.g. GhostRoot channels)
- **Prior art:** Earlier CVEs (CVE-2022-47339, CVE-2025-31710) targeted the same Unisoc services, indicating sustained researcher and adversary interest.
- **EPSS:** Moderate EPSS (~0.0007) reflects that this is a local, device-specific issue rather than a widely scanned network bug.

Given the availability of weaponised scripts, malware authors targeting Unisoc-based devices are well-placed to integrate this into privilege-escalation chains.

### 6. Recommended Mitigations

- **Firmware updates:**
  - Apply vendor firmware updates that fully remediate both CVE-2025-31710 and CVE-2025-67264.
  - Where available, prefer builds that remove or harden EngineerMode and restrict `cmd_skt` access.
- **Device and policy controls:**
  - Disable ADB on production devices and restrict developer options.
  - Where supported, enforce bootloader locking and verified boot to prevent persistent rootkits.
  - Use mobile threat defence solutions capable of detecting suspicious EngineerMode activity, root shells, or unusual use of abstract sockets like `cmd_skt`.
- **Fleet management:**
  - For enterprises managing Doogee or Unisoc-based fleets, consider:
    - Phasing out affected models where patches are unavailable or untrusted
    - Tightening MDM policies to block side-loaded apps and enforce OS integrity checks.

These mitigations raise the cost and complexity of using CVE-2025-67264 as a routine privilege-escalation technique, reducing its practical kill chain utility in managed environments.
