### Methodology Document: Work-Aware Prioritisation and Kill Chain Utility

#### 1\. Executive Summary: The Sociological Paradox of Vulnerability Management

Modern vulnerability management is currently hindered by what researchers call a **"sociological paradox"**: just as crime rates historically rose in the mid-20th century despite improved living standards, cyber-vulnerabilities are expanding exponentially in both number and complexity despite superior technological protections 1, 2\. While the industry relies on the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** as a standard, this system measures only **technical severity** (the intrinsic damage potential of a code flaw) rather than the **dynamic threat factors** that determine if a vulnerability will actually be weaponised 3-6. This document provides AI agents with a methodology to assess risk based on the **Work-Averse Attacker (WAA)** model and **Kill Chain Utility**, shifting prioritisation from "how bad is the flaw?" to "how useful is this flaw to a rational actor seeking maximum return for minimum effort?" 6, 7\.

#### 2\. The Work-Averse Attacker (WAA) Model

The WAA model is rooted in the **"logic of inaction"** and microeconomic principles, viewing cyberattackers not as all-powerful saboteurs, but as **resource-limited, risk-neutral actors** operating under strict economic constraints 2, 7\.

* **Fixed vs. Variable Costs:** Developing a novel zero-day exploit involves **high initial fixed costs** in terms of human cognition, time-intensive engineering, and specialised expertise 6, 7\. Conversely, reusing existing Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code or acquiring exploits from cybercrime black markets represents a **low variable cost** 7\.  
* **The Economy of Inaction:** Attacker decision-making follows a pattern where "doing nothing" is the preferred strategy until the perceived utility of a new attack becomes positive compared to existing tools 2, 7\. Attackers will **systematically prioritise minimising effort and cost** and will only update their "exploit portfolio" when current tools become ineffective 6, 7\.  
* **The "One Exploit Per Version" Rule:** Empirical evidence from two million attack signatures shows that **"WAA generally deploys only one exploit per software version before seeking entirely new targets"** 6, 7\. Once a version is compromised at scale, additional vulnerabilities in that same version provide no marginal utility relative to the high fixed cost of weaponisation; thus, they are largely ignored 7\.

#### 3\. Why CVSS Fails the Kill Chain

While CVSS is the industry standard, its **Base Score** is an unsuitable proxy for actual exploitation risk and leads to significant resource misallocation 4-6.

* **Statistical Randomness:** Large-scale analysis has proven that **"relying solely on a high CVSS base score for prioritisation is statistically meaningless and statistically indistinguishable from randomly selecting vulnerabilities to fix"** 4, 6\. CVSS-only policies frequently yield **negligible risk reductions** 4, 6\.  
* **The Exploitation Gap:** **"Only about 6.4% of all published vulnerabilities are ever observed being exploited in the wild"** 1, 6, 8\. CVSS fails to distinguish this high-risk minority from the thousands of "theoretical" critical flaws that are never weaponised 4, 6\.  
* **Lack of Variability:** The CVSS Exploitability subscore exhibits **little to no variability**; most vulnerabilities are scored with "Network" access and "None" for authentication, making the metric effectively a constant that cannot predict the likelihood of an attack 4, 6\.  
* **Contextual Blindness:** CVSS provides a **"one-size-fits-all"** assessment that ignores specific execution contexts 6, 9\. Differential severity analysis shows that vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel manifest entirely different risks when deployed in downstream Android systems due to different configurations and permissions 9\.

#### 4\. Methodology: Categorisation by Kill Chain Utility

**PRIMARY PRINCIPLE: Kill Chain Applicability is the Key Factor**

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Always start with Kill Chain applicability, not categories.**
> 
> **Step 1:** Think like an attacker - "Where can I use this? What value does it bring?"
> 
> **Step 2:** Assess kill chain utility - Initial access? Post-compromise? What barriers exist?
> 
> **Step 3:** Apply category fine-tuning - Use categories to support your kill chain assessment

AI agents must **always start with Kill Chain applicability** as the primary assessment factor. However, **before** kill chain analysis, analysts must first conduct a comprehensive **Software Assessment** to understand the software's deployment, network reachability, and execution context. This information is **essential** to correctly assess where in the kill chain the vulnerability can be used, or if it can be used at all.

**STEP 0: Software Assessment (Required Before Kill Chain Analysis)**

Before assessing kill chain utility, analysts must gather comprehensive information about the software and its application:

1. **Network Reachability Assessment:**
   - **Is the software network-reachable?** (Can it be accessed over the network?)
     - Network-enabled service? (Listens on network ports, accessible via network)
     - Local tool only? (No network interface, requires local/system access)
     - Hybrid? (Can be used both locally and over network)
   - **Is it often network-enabled?** (Common deployment pattern includes network access)
     - Typically exposed to network in common deployments?
     - Often configured with network access enabled?
     - Or typically used only locally?
   - **Network accessibility implications:**
     - Network-reachable = Potential for external exploitation (higher kill chain utility)
     - Local tool only = Requires access first (lower kill chain utility, post-compromise)

2. **Deployment Context Assessment:**
   - **What is the software's primary application?**
     - Public-facing service? (Web server, API, public application)
     - Backend processing tool? (Internal service, processing engine)
     - Local utility? (Command-line tool, desktop application)
     - System service? (OS component, system daemon)
   - **Where is it typically deployed?**
     - Internet-facing? (Exposed to public internet)
     - LAN/Internal only? (Behind firewall, internal network)
     - Cloud service? (SaaS, cloud-hosted)
     - On-premises? (Enterprise internal deployment)
     - IoT device? (Embedded systems, smart devices)
   - **Common deployment patterns:**
     - Research typical deployment scenarios for this software
     - Assess most common use case (public-facing vs internal)
     - Consider hybrid deployments (some public, some internal)

3. **Execution Context Assessment:**
   - **What privilege level does the software typically run as?**
     - Root/Administrator? (Highest privilege, potential for privilege escalation)
     - System/Service account? (Elevated privilege, may enable escalation)
     - Standard user? (Limited privilege, requires escalation for higher access)
     - Unprivileged? (Low privilege, minimal escalation potential)
   - **Privilege escalation implications:**
     - Software running as root/admin = Vulnerability may enable privilege escalation
     - Software running as standard user = Less likely to enable privilege escalation
     - Assess if vulnerability in privileged software can be leveraged for escalation
   - **Execution environment:**
     - Containerized? (Docker, Kubernetes - container escape potential)
     - Virtualized? (VM escape potential)
     - Bare metal? (Direct system access)
     - Cloud? (Cloud-specific attack vectors)

4. **Application-Specific Context:**
   - **If it's a backend processing tool:**
     - Where is it typically deployed? (Internal servers, cloud, on-premises)
     - What does it process? (Sensitive data, user data, system data)
     - Who has access? (Internal users, external users, automated systems)
   - **If it's a network service:**
     - What protocols does it use? (HTTP, TCP, UDP, proprietary)
     - Is it typically authenticated? (Requires credentials, or open access)
     - What is its typical exposure? (Internet, internal network, VPN-only)
   - **If it's a local tool:**
     - What access is required? (Local system, user account, admin)
     - Is it used in privilege escalation contexts? (Commonly used for escalation)
     - Does it process sensitive data? (Credentials, keys, configuration)

**Critical:** This software assessment information is **required** before kill chain analysis. Without understanding network reachability, deployment context, and execution privilege, it is impossible to correctly assess:
- Where in the kill chain the vulnerability can be used
- What barriers exist for exploitation
- What value the vulnerability provides to attackers
- Whether the vulnerability has any real-world application

**Example Software Assessment:**
- Software: Apache HTTP Server
  - Network-reachable: YES (listens on ports 80/443)
  - Often network-enabled: YES (primary function is network service)
  - Deployment: Typically public-facing (web servers) or internal (intranet)
  - Execution context: Typically runs as non-root user (www-data, apache)
  - Application: Web server, often internet-facing
  - Assessment: Network-reachable, often public-facing → High potential for external exploitation

- Software: Local file processing utility
  - Network-reachable: NO (local tool, no network interface)
  - Often network-enabled: NO (designed for local use only)
  - Deployment: Typically on local systems, not network-exposed
  - Execution context: Runs as user who executes it (varies)
  - Application: Local file processing, no network component
  - Assessment: Local tool only → Requires access first, post-compromise utility

Now, with this software assessment complete, analysts can proceed to kill chain analysis:

1. **"Where can I use this vulnerability in an attack?"** - What stage of the kill chain does this enable?
   - Initial access? (External exploitation without prerequisites)
   - Post-compromise? (Requires initial access first)
   - Lateral movement? (Requires foothold in network)
   - Privilege escalation? (Requires authenticated access)
   - Persistence? (Requires system access)

2. **"What value does this bring to me as an attacker?"** - What can I achieve with this vulnerability?
   - Can I gain initial access from outside? (High value)
   - Can I execute code remotely? (High value)
   - Can I access sensitive data? (High value)
   - Can I only view settings? (Low value)
   - Do I need to already be on the network? (Lower value - requires network access)
   - Do I need authentication first? (Lower value - requires credential compromise)

3. **"What barriers prevent me from using this immediately?"** - What prerequisites must I meet?
   - No barriers? (Can exploit immediately from outside)
   - Requires authentication? (Need credentials first)
   - Requires network-level access? (Need MitM or network compromise)
   - Requires user interaction? (Need social engineering)
   - Requires specific configuration? (Limited attack surface)

4. **"What is the common deployment scenario for this software?"** - How is this typically deployed? (This should already be known from Software Assessment Step 0)
   - **Public-facing?** (Exposed to internet, accessible from outside) → Higher kill chain utility for external attackers
   - **LAN/Internal only?** (Behind firewall, internal network only) → Lower kill chain utility, requires network access first
   - **Backend processing tool?** (Internal service, where deployed, what processes)
   - **IoT device?** (Special considerations - often exposed, used in botnets, mass exploitation potential)
   - **Local tool?** (No network interface, requires local access) → Post-compromise utility only
   - **Hybrid?** (Some public-facing, some internal) → Assess based on most common scenario
   
   **Deployment Scenario Impact:**
   - **Public-facing software** with unauthenticated vulnerabilities = Maximum kill chain utility (TIER 1 potential)
   - **LAN/internal software** with unauthenticated vulnerabilities = Lower kill chain utility (requires network access first, TIER 2 or TIER 3)
   - **Backend processing tools** = Assess based on deployment location and access requirements
   - **Local tools** = Post-compromise utility only (TIER 3 or TIER 4)
   - **IoT devices** often have unique deployment patterns (exposed to internet, used in botnets, mass exploitation) → Special category consideration
   
5. **"What is the execution context?"** - What privilege level does the software run as? (This should already be known from Software Assessment Step 0)
   - **Root/Administrator?** → Potential for privilege escalation if vulnerability can be leveraged
   - **System/Service account?** → May enable privilege escalation depending on vulnerability
   - **Standard user?** → Less likely to enable privilege escalation
   - **Containerized?** → Potential for container escape
   - **Execution context implications:**
     - Software running as root/admin with vulnerability = May enable privilege escalation (higher value)
     - Software running as standard user = Less likely to enable escalation (lower value)
     - Containerized software = May enable container escape (higher value if escape possible)

**Assessment Flow:**
1. **Software Assessment (REQUIRED FIRST):** Gather comprehensive information about the software:
   - Network reachability (network-enabled vs local tool)
   - Deployment context (public-facing, internal, backend processing, etc.)
   - Execution context (privilege level, root/admin, containerized, etc.)
   - Application-specific context (where deployed, who has access, what it processes)
2. **Kill Chain Analysis:** Think like an attacker - where does this fit in the attack lifecycle? (Use software assessment information)
3. **Assess Attacker Value:** What can be achieved? What barriers exist? How does software context affect exploitability?
4. **Apply Category Fine-Tuning:** Use the categories document to adjust based on specific factors (authentication, MitM, impact level, deployment scenario, execution context, etc.)

**Critical:** The categories in Section 4.B and the categories document are **fine-tuning tools** to support your kill chain assessment, not the starting point. Always begin with the attacker perspective: "Where can I use this? What value does it bring?"

To achieve maximum risk reduction, AI agents must transition to categorising vulnerabilities based on their **Kill Chain Utility**—the intersection of **Likelihood** and **Attacker Effort** 6\.  
**A. Exploitation Likelihood (Predictive Power)**Agents should move away from static CVSS scores toward predictive indicators like the **Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)** 6, 8\.

* **Efficiency Gains:** EPSS achieves a predictive power (AUC) of **0.7795**, compared to just **0.051** for CVSS 6, 8\. Leveraging EPSS allows defenders to achieve high coverage by remediating only **7.3% of all CVEs**, whereas a CVSS-centric strategy would require patching **58.1%** to achieve the same level of safety 6, 8\.

**A.1. GitHub Exploit Reference Assessment**

When Vulners or other vulnerability databases reference a GitHub URL for exploit code, **analysts must look up and assess the actual GitHub repository content**. Not all GitHub references contain ready-to-use exploits—many are only writeups, documentation, or incomplete code.

**Critical Assessment Steps:**

1. **Lookup the GitHub URL:** If a GitHub reference is provided, access the repository and examine its contents.

2. **Assess Content Type:**
   - **Ready-to-Use Exploit Code:** Contains executable scripts, compiled binaries, or complete exploit code that can be run directly with minimal modification. This significantly reduces attacker fixed costs (Category F1 or F1b).
   - **Detailed Writeup with Sufficient Technical Details:** Contains comprehensive technical documentation, proof-of-concept descriptions, or detailed analysis that enables an attacker to write their own exploit with reasonable effort. This moderately reduces attacker fixed costs.
   - **Basic Writeup or Incomplete Information:** Contains only high-level descriptions, partial information, or insufficient technical details. This provides minimal reduction in attacker fixed costs and should not be treated as "public PoC available."

3. **Evaluate Exploit Quality:**
   - **Complete and Functional:** Code is complete, tested, and functional → Maximum weaponization cost reduction
   - **Requires Minor Modification:** Code is mostly complete but needs small adjustments (<10 lines of code) → High weaponization cost reduction
   - **Requires Significant Development:** Code is incomplete, requires substantial modification, or only provides conceptual framework → Moderate to low weaponization cost reduction
   - **Writeup Only:** No code, only documentation or analysis → Low weaponization cost reduction (unless extremely detailed)

4. **Classification Based on Assessment:**
   - **Ready-to-Use Exploit:** Treat as "Public PoC with High Reliability" (Category F1 or F1b)
   - **Detailed Writeup (Easy to Implement):** Treat as "Public PoC with Moderate Reliability" - may increase priority but not as significantly as ready-to-use code
   - **Basic Writeup or Incomplete:** Do NOT treat as "public PoC available" - this is misleading and overstates exploitation likelihood

**WAA Impact Assessment:**
- **Ready-to-use exploit code:** Weaponization cost near-zero → High kill chain utility
- **Detailed writeup (easy to implement):** Weaponization cost low → Moderate kill chain utility
- **Basic writeup or incomplete:** Weaponization cost moderate to high → Lower kill chain utility

**Example Assessment:**
- GitHub repository contains Python script with complete exploit code → Ready-to-use exploit (Category F1/F1b)
- GitHub repository contains detailed technical analysis with step-by-step exploitation guide → Detailed writeup (moderate weaponization cost reduction)
- GitHub repository contains only CVE description and basic impact statement → Basic writeup (do not treat as PoC available)

**B. Attacker Technical Demands (The WAA Mantra: Reliability and Ease)**Beyond simple likelihood, agents must evaluate the **intrinsic difficulty** of an exploit, as the WAA demands **reliability and repeatability** 6\. Factors that increase attacker "fixed costs" and decrease utility include:

* **High Attack Complexity:** Vulnerabilities requiring specific timing or rare memory layouts (e.g., race conditions) are less attractive to mass actors 6\.  
* **Instability:** Exploits that cause system crashes or require high repetition to succeed increase detection risk and campaign failure 6\.  
* **Platform Dependencies:** Vulnerabilities that only function on obscure technical configurations increase research costs 6, 9\.
* **Network-Level Access Requirements (Man-in-the-Middle):** Vulnerabilities that require **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position** or **network-level access** (network spoofing, ARP poisoning, compromised network infrastructure) represent **significant barriers** that fundamentally change the threat model. These include:
  * **Plaintext Credential Transmission:** Vulnerabilities that expose credentials in plaintext require MitM position to intercept traffic. This is **not** "no barriers" - it requires network-level access, which is difficult to achieve and represents a significant barrier. These should be **decreased by 2 tiers** or assigned to **TIER 3** unless they provide high-impact gain beyond credential interception (e.g., direct authentication bypass without MitM).
  * **Network Sniffing Requirements:** Any vulnerability requiring the attacker to be on the network path (router compromise, network infrastructure access) is a significant barrier.
  * **WAA Impact:** Network-level access is difficult to obtain and increases attacker fixed costs significantly. External attackers cannot exploit these vulnerabilities without first compromising network infrastructure or being physically/network-positioned on the target network.
* **Authentication Requirements (Internal Threat Classification):** Vulnerabilities requiring authentication fundamentally shift the threat model from external to internal, significantly reducing kill chain utility for external attackers 4, 6\. The WAA model dictates that requiring authentication increases attacker effort and limits attack surface, thus lowering priority:
  * **All Authenticated Users:** If any authenticated user can exploit the vulnerability, it represents an **internal threat** but maintains moderate utility for insider risk scenarios. Priority should be **reduced by one tier** compared to unauthenticated vulnerabilities.
  * **Admin-Level Users Only:** If exploitation requires administrative privileges, the threat is further diminished, as administrators already possess legitimate means to perform most actions. These vulnerabilities should be **reduced by two tiers** or classified as **TIER 4** unless they enable privilege escalation from lower-privileged accounts. The rationale: if an attacker already has admin access, they can achieve objectives through legitimate channels without exploiting the vulnerability.
* **Local Tools Requiring Environment Access (No Privilege Escalation, No Code Execution):** Vulnerabilities in **local tools** that require the attacker to **already have access to the environment** and that:
  * **Do not enable privilege escalation** (not used in privilege escalation contexts)
  * **Do not allow code execution** (cannot execute arbitrary code)
  * **Do not provide significant attacker value** beyond what legitimate access already provides
  
  These vulnerabilities should be classified as **TIER 4** - they have **no threat value** and are **not useful as an arsenal tool**. If an attacker already has access to the environment, they can achieve objectives through legitimate means without exploiting the vulnerability. The vulnerability provides no additional value to an attacker's toolkit.
  
  **Examples:**
  - Local tool vulnerabilities that only allow information disclosure (view-only) when the attacker already has access
  - Local tool vulnerabilities that require admin access but don't enable privilege escalation or code execution
  - Local utility vulnerabilities that don't enhance attacker capabilities beyond legitimate access
* **Internal/Local Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Denial of Service vulnerabilities that:
  * Require **internal network access** (attacker must already be inside the network)
  * OR affect **local, non-network-reachable software** (software not accessible from the network)
  
  These vulnerabilities should be classified as **TIER 4** - there is **no real-world application** for such attacks. Once inside the network, attackers want to **stay silent and not disrupt anything**. Internal DoS attacks are:
  * **Counterproductive:** Disruption draws attention and increases detection risk
  * **Not useful in attacker toolkits:** Attackers with network access want persistence and data exfiltration, not service disruption
  * **No kill chain utility:** DoS from inside provides no value - attackers already have access
  
  **Exception:** External DoS vulnerabilities (exploitable from outside the network) may have value for DDoS campaigns or external disruption, but internal/local DoS = TIER 4.
  
  **Examples:**
  - DoS vulnerabilities in local services requiring network access
  - DoS vulnerabilities in non-network-reachable software
  - Internal DoS that requires being on the network first

**C. The Kill Chain Utility Formula**

The priority level for a vulnerability is calculated using the following logic 6:  
**Low Attacker Effort / Ease of Use × High Attacker Gain / Impact \= High Priority**.

**Assessment Approach:**
1. **First, think like an attacker:** "Can I use this for initial access from outside? What value does it provide?"
2. **Assess deployment scenario:** "How is this typically deployed? Public-facing? LAN/internal? IoT device?"
3. **Then assess barriers:** "What do I need to do first? Do I need credentials? Network access? User interaction?"
4. **Finally, apply category adjustments:** Use the categories document to fine-tune based on specific factors.

**Example Assessment Flow:**
- **Deployment Question:** "Is this typically public-facing?" → If YES, unauthenticated vulnerabilities have higher kill chain utility
- **Deployment Question:** "Is this typically LAN/internal only?" → If YES, even unauthenticated vulnerabilities require network access first (lower kill chain utility)
- **Deployment Question:** "Is this an IoT device?" → If YES, consider mass exploitation potential and botnet usage
- **Kill Chain Question:** "Can I use this to gain initial access from outside without any prerequisites?" → If YES, public-facing, and provides high value (RCE, data breach), likely TIER 1
- **Kill Chain Question:** "Can I use this, but it's typically LAN/internal only?" → If YES, requires network access first, likely TIER 2 or TIER 3
- **Kill Chain Question:** "Can I use this, but I need to be on the network first (MitM)?" → If YES, this is a significant barrier, likely TIER 3
- **Kill Chain Question:** "Can I use this, but I need authentication first?" → If YES and only provides view-only access, likely TIER 3
- **Kill Chain Question:** "Can I use this only after I already have access?" → If YES, this is post-compromise utility, likely TIER 3

**Critical Rule: Barriers + Low Impact Gain = Never TIER 1 or TIER 2**

If a vulnerability has **significant barriers or prerequisites** (authentication, **Man-in-the-Middle/network-level access**, specific configurations, user interaction, etc.) AND does not provide **high-impact gain** (remote code execution, data breach, privilege escalation to admin, system compromise), it should **never** be classified as TIER 1 or TIER 2, regardless of other factors such as public PoC availability or active exploitation.

**Important:** Plaintext credential transmission vulnerabilities that **require Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position** to intercept credentials are **not** "no barriers" - they require network-level access (network spoofing, ARP poisoning, compromised network infrastructure), which is a **significant barrier**. If the vulnerability only enables credential interception (not direct authentication bypass), it is **barriers + low-impact gain** and should be **TIER 3**, not TIER 1 or TIER 2.

**High-Impact Gain Criteria:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Ability to execute arbitrary code on the target system
- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (credentials, PII, financial data)
- **Privilege Escalation:** Escalation from unauthenticated/low-privilege to administrative/system-level access
- **System Compromise:** Complete control over the target system or service
- **Critical Infrastructure Disruption:** Ability to disrupt critical services or operations

**Low-Impact Gain Examples (Not Sufficient for TIER 1/2 with Barriers):**
- **Client-Side Attacks Only:** XSS, clickjacking, or other attacks requiring user interaction
- **Phishing Facilitation:** Vulnerabilities that only enable phishing campaigns or social engineering
- **Information Disclosure (Limited):** Disclosure of non-sensitive information or metadata
- **Information Disclosure (View-Only):** Ability to **view** settings, configurations, or data **without modification capability**. If a vulnerability only allows viewing (read-only access) and does not enable modification, code execution, or privilege escalation, it is **low-impact gain**, not high-impact gain.
- **Content Manipulation:** Ability to modify content but not execute code or access sensitive data
- **Plaintext Credential Transmission (Requires MitM):** Vulnerabilities that transmit credentials in plaintext but **require Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position** to exploit. The MitM requirement is a significant barrier, and if the vulnerability only enables credential interception (not direct authentication bypass), it is **low-impact gain** when combined with the MitM barrier.
- **Authentication Bypass (View-Only):** Vulnerabilities that bypass authentication but only allow **viewing** settings or information without modification capability. These are **low-impact gain** - information disclosure only, not system compromise.
- **Denial of Service:** Service disruption without system compromise
  - **Exception - Internal/Local DoS:** Denial of Service vulnerabilities that:
    * Require **internal network access** (attacker already inside the network)
    * OR affect **local, non-network-reachable software** (not accessible from network)
    * Should be classified as **TIER 4** - there is **no real-world application** for such attacks. Once inside the network, attackers want to **stay silent and not disrupt anything**. Internal DoS attacks are counterproductive and not useful in attacker toolkits.
- **Local Privilege Escalation (Post-Compromise):** Escalation that requires initial authenticated access

**Examples:**
- A vulnerability requiring Contributor-level authentication that only enables content manipulation or client-side attacks (e.g., IDOR allowing field modification, XSS requiring authentication) should be classified as **TIER 3 (Arsenal Value)** or **TIER 4**, not TIER 2, even if a public PoC exists or it's actively exploited.
- A **plaintext credential transmission** vulnerability that **requires Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position** to intercept credentials should be classified as **TIER 3**, not TIER 1 or TIER 2. The MitM requirement is a significant barrier (network-level access), and if the vulnerability only enables credential interception (not direct authentication bypass), it is **barriers + low-impact gain**.
- An **authentication bypass** that only allows **viewing settings** without modification capability should be classified as **TIER 3**, not TIER 1 or TIER 2. This is information disclosure (view-only), which is low-impact gain, especially when combined with any barriers (authentication bypass complexity, network requirements, etc.).

**D. Authentication-Based Threat Adjustment**When evaluating kill chain utility, authentication requirements serve as a critical de-prioritisation factor:

* **No Authentication Required (External Threat):** Maximum kill chain utility—exploitable by any external actor without prior access. Maintains original priority tier.
* **Authentication Required - All Users (Internal Threat):** Reduced kill chain utility—requires insider access or compromised credentials. **Decrease priority by one tier** (e.g., TIER 1 → TIER 2, TIER 2 → TIER 3, TIER 3 → TIER 4).
* **Authentication Required - Admin Only (Privileged Internal Threat):** Minimal kill chain utility—administrators can achieve objectives through legitimate means. **Decrease priority by two tiers** or assign to **TIER 4** unless the vulnerability enables privilege escalation from non-admin accounts. Exception: If the vulnerability allows **privilege escalation from standard user to admin**, it should be evaluated as an **external-to-internal attack vector** and may maintain higher priority (typically TIER 2 or TIER 3).

#### 5\. Actionable Integrated Assessment Tiers

AI agents should triage vulnerabilities into four actionable tiers based on their applicability to the active kill chain 6:

* **TIER 1 \- IMMEDIATE (High Kill Chain Utility):** Vulnerabilities that are **actively exploited** in the wild or where exploitation is **trivial and reliable** 6\. Typically **unauthenticated** or requiring minimal attacker effort. These represent the highest immediate threat as they can be exploited by external attackers without prerequisites.  
* *Response:* Patch immediately via **emergency change control**.  

* **TIER 2 \- HIGH VALUE BUT BARRIERED (Significant Barriers/Prerequisites):** Vulnerabilities that are **exploited in the wild** or have **public exploits available**, but have **significant barriers or prerequisites** that prevent immediate external exploitation 6, 8\. **Critical Requirement:** These must provide **high-impact gain** (RCE, data breach, privilege escalation to admin, system compromise) despite barriers. These include:
  * **Privilege escalation** vulnerabilities that enable escalation from unauthenticated/low-privilege to admin/system access (require initial access but provide high value)
  * **Authenticated RCE** vulnerabilities (require authentication but provide code execution)
  * **Authenticated data breach** vulnerabilities (require authentication but enable access to sensitive data)
  * **Authenticated vulnerabilities** with public PoCs that provide high-impact gain (RCE, data breach) but require credential compromise
  
  These represent **potential big damage to the organization** with **high-impact gain** but are **not immediate threats** because attackers **cannot access them from the outside** for immediate attack without first establishing a foothold or compromising credentials.  
  
  **Exclusion:** Vulnerabilities with barriers that only provide **low-impact gain** (client-side attacks, phishing facilitation, content manipulation without code execution, limited information disclosure) should **never** be TIER 2, regardless of active exploitation or public PoC availability. These belong in TIER 3 or TIER 4.
  
* *Response:* Patch within **7–14 days**; use fast-track remediation workflows. Prioritise based on likelihood of prerequisite conditions being met (e.g., credential compromise risk, insider threat probability).

* **TIER 3 \- ARSENAL VALUE (Post-Compromise Utility):** Vulnerabilities that have **value to an attacker in their arsenal** but are **only useful once access to the system is gained** 6\. These have **significant prerequisites required** and are typically:
  * **Local privilege escalation** vulnerabilities (useful after initial compromise)
  * **Authenticated vulnerabilities** requiring specific user roles or configurations that provide **limited impact gain** (content manipulation, client-side attacks, phishing facilitation, limited information disclosure)
  * **Authenticated vulnerabilities** with barriers that do **not** provide high-impact gain (RCE, data breach, system compromise)
  * **Post-exploitation** vulnerabilities that enhance attacker capabilities but don't provide initial access
  * Vulnerabilities with **public PoCs** but high complexity or specific environmental requirements
  * **Client-side only** vulnerabilities (XSS, clickjacking) requiring authentication
  * **Phishing facilitation** vulnerabilities that require authenticated access
  
  The WAA may include these in their toolkit for use in multi-stage attacks, but they do not provide immediate external attack vectors. **Note:** Even if actively exploited or have public PoCs, vulnerabilities with barriers that only provide low-impact gain (no code execution, no data breach) belong in TIER 3, not TIER 2.  
* *Response:* Address within **30–60 days**; include in standard patching cycles with appropriate prioritisation based on post-compromise impact.

* **TIER 4 \- SCHEDULED (Low Kill Chain Utility):** Vulnerabilities characterised by **high complexity**, technical **instability**, those that remain purely **theoretical**, **admin-only authenticated vulnerabilities** where legitimate administrative access already provides equivalent capabilities, **local tool vulnerabilities** that require environment access but do not enable privilege escalation or code execution, or **internal/local Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** 6\. These have minimal kill chain utility and are unlikely to be weaponised by WAA actors.  
* *Response:* Address during the **standard patching cycle**; low priority unless other factors change.
  
  **Special Case - Local Tools with No Utility:**
  - If a vulnerability is in a **local tool** that requires the attacker to **already have access to the environment**
  - AND the vulnerability **does not enable privilege escalation** (not used in privilege escalation contexts)
  - AND the vulnerability **does not allow code execution**
  - Then it is **TIER 4** - no threat value and not useful as an arsenal tool. Attackers with access can achieve objectives through legitimate means.
  
  **Special Case - Internal/Local DoS Attacks:**
  - If a vulnerability causes **Denial of Service** but requires **internal network access** (attacker already inside)
  - OR affects **local, non-network-reachable software** (not accessible from network)
  - Then it is **TIER 4** - no real-world application. Once inside the network, attackers want to stay silent and not disrupt anything. Internal DoS attacks are counterproductive and not useful in attacker toolkits.

**Note on Authentication-Based Tier Adjustment:** When a vulnerability requires authentication, apply the tier reduction rules from Section 4.D before final classification. For example, a vulnerability that would normally be TIER 1 but requires admin authentication should be classified as TIER 4, unless it enables privilege escalation from lower-privileged accounts (in which case it may be TIER 2 or TIER 3).
